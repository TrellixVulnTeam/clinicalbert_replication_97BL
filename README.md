# clinicalbert_replication
In this project, the main purpose is to replicate the result of clinicalBERT from paper ClinicalBERT: Modeling Clinical Notes and Predicting Hospital Readmission by Kexin Huang, Jaan Altosaar, Rajesh Ranganath. The original repo for clinicalBERT can be found https://github.com/kexinhuang12345/clinicalBERT.

In addition to that, this repo also tries to replicate the baseline models including Bag-of-Words and BI-LSTM mentioned from the paper Whatâ€™s in a Note? Unpacking Predictive Value in Clinical Note Representations by Willie Boag, B.S.,1,* Dustin Doss, S.B.,1,* Tristan Naumann, M.S.,1,* and Peter Szolovits, Ph.D.1. The original repo for baselines can be found https://github.com/wboag/wian/tree/13bc79ebf7724aa007dbb436b4daa1ddd40e4734.

Modifications are made in order to carry out the experiments.
